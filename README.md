# Slab Deflection Checks to EC2üèó
This is a simple and user-friendly Jupyter notebook that allows you to perform deflection checks for reinforced concrete slabs according to EC2 standards. It was developed to fill the gap left by CSC Orion's lack of deflection check functionality.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file, `SlabDeflCheck.ipynb`
2. Input your desired values using the intuitive text widgets provided.
3. Run the notebook to generate the design check results.
4. Inspect the results to ensure the deflection meets EC2 standards.
